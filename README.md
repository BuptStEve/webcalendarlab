# webcalendarlab
##a web calendar app similar to icalendar of icloud and based on caldavzap
Contrary to caldavzap,we focused on best user-experience of calendar based on caldav protocol, and  something happened as follows:<br>
 1.the brand new user-interface and user-experience like icalendar in style<br>
 2.add/remove/modify a calendar<br>
 3.query /subscribe  a calendar<br>
 4.share a calendar<br>
 5.a event invited<br>
 6.notification <br>
 
 Now,we are refactoring it  by working with vue.js and React
