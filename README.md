# webcalendarlab
 a web calendar app similar to icalendar of icloud and based on caldavzap(http://www.inf-it.com/caldavzap/)
 Contrary to caldavzap,we focused on best user-experience of calendar based on caldav protocol, and  something happened as follows:
 1.the brand new user-interface and user-experience like icalendar in style
 2.add/remove/modify a calendar
 3.query /subscribe  a calendar
 4.share a calendar
 5.a event invited
 6. notification 
 
 Now,we are refactoring the webcalendarlab  by working with vue.js and React
